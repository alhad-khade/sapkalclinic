                      reduce degeneration thus reduce stiffness.

                      electrochemistry out of balance and drastic loss of

                      Inflammatory conditions differs significantly from that of
                      Degenerative conditions. Timely therapy & treatment is
                      needed.

                      Swedana is the fomentation or sudation therapy in Ayurveda
                      involving the procedure to induce sweat or perspiration in
                      the body using steam generated from medicated herbal
                      decoctions. It is one among the preparatory procedures of
                      Panchkarma to open up the channels of the body to aid in
                      the effective elimination of toxins. Fomentation is given
                      after abhyanga or an Ayurvedic full body massage for an
                      enhanced detoxification.

                    <p>

                      tension and inflammation, promoting blood circulation and
                      to clear the energy passages. Swedana is also recommended

                      doshas.

                      It is nourishing; pacifies the doshas, relieves fatigue,
                      provides stamina, pleasure, and perfect sleep, enhances

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The aforementioned phrase from an Ayurvedic textbook
                      captures the many benefits of using a body massage oil
                      daily. Before spas became popular, the art of massaging
                      self with oil, also known as Abhyanga, was practiced
                      extensively by people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Even today, body massage is considered a powerful healing
                      technique in Ayurveda. A good oil massage releases the
                      accumulated stress and toxins from the body, leaving you
                      feeling energized and rejuvenated.

                    <h4>Arthritis Treatment</h4>
                    <p>
                      Rheumatoid Arthritis (known as Amavata in Ayurveda) is an
                      autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation and
                      severe pain inthe joints. It can also cause inflammation
                      of the tissue around the joints, as well as in other
                      organs in the body such as eyes, kidneys, heart and lungs.
                      Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the
                      body's tissues are mistakenly attacked by their own immune
                      system. Patients with autoimmune diseases such as Amavata
                      have antibodies in their blood that target their own body
                      tissues, where they can be associated with inflammation.
                      Because it can affect multiple other organs of the body,
                      Rheumatoid Arthritis, or Amavata is referred to as a
                      systemic illness and is sometimes called rheumatoid
                      disease.

                    I had a problem of white dishcharge with stomachache and
                    shrinking of urethra. I had taken lots Allopathy medicines
                    for 6-7 years to treat those disorders. One of my close
                    relative suggested me to concern Dr.Manjusha Sapkal for
                    Ayurvedic treatment .The problem of white dishcharge caused
                    extreme stomachache and could be a sign of cancer. I had
                    done several Papsmere tests to detect it. But luckily I
                    started Ayurvedic treatment by Dr.Sapkal and it was a
                    miracle that my disorders started to cure within 3-4 months
                    only and the stomachache stopped and urine flow also came to
                    normal. She always treated me with tender loving care
                    because she really do care. I have always been able to talk
                    to the Dr.Manjusha and get my problems resolved going her is
                    like dealing with trusted family. I really appreciate your
                    weekend hours, hours when our regular doctors don't talk to
                    us or see us. I am very thankful to her.

                    I was suffering from a server pain of Sciatica. I came to
                    know about Dr. Manjusha Sapkal from my relatives and from
                    the first treatment itself my pain started healing. What I
                    most liked about Dr. Manjusha's treatment is that her caring
                    nature and personalised attention to my illness which gave
                    me confidence that I can overcome the pain. I would highly
                    recommend receiving treatment from Dr. Manjusha.

                    My experience with Dr.Sapkal is very good. Basically I 
                    believe in naturopathy & Ayurveda. Her knowledge in this 
                    field is of great benefit for all type of patients. Her 
                    clinic has a unique personal touch with everyone which is a 
                    good part of her nature. Panchakarma was a very nice 
                    experience.
