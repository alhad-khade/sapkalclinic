                    I had a problem of white dishcharge with stomachache and
                    shrinking of urethra. I had taken lots Allopathy medicines
                    for 6-7 years to treat those disorders. One of my close
                    relative suggested me to concern Dr.Manjusha Sapkal for
                    Ayurvedic treatment .The problem of white dishcharge caused
                    extreme stomachache and could be a sign of cancer. I had
                    done several Papsmere tests to detect it. But luckily I
                    started Ayurvedic treatment by Dr.Sapkal and it was a
                    miracle that my disorders started to cure within 3-4 months
                    only and the stomachache stopped and urine flow also came to
                    normal. She always treated me with tender loving care
                    because she really do care. I have always been able to talk
                    to the Dr.Manjusha and get my problems resolved going her is
                    like dealing with trusted family. I really appreciate your
                    weekend hours, hours when our regular doctors don't talk to
                    us or see us. I am very thankful to her.

                    I was suffering from a server pain of Sciatica. I came to
                    know about Dr. Manjusha Sapkal from my relatives and from
                    the first treatment itself my pain started healing. What I
                    most liked about Dr. Manjusha's treatment is that her caring
                    nature and personalised attention to my illness which gave
                    me confidence that I can overcome the pain. I would highly
                    recommend receiving treatment from Dr. Manjusha.

                    My experience with Dr.Sapkal is very good. Basically I 
                    believe in naturopathy & Ayurveda. Her knowledge in this 
                    field is of great benefit for all type of patients. Her 
                    clinic has a unique personal touch with everyone which is a 
                    good part of her nature. Panchakarma was a very nice 
                    experience.
